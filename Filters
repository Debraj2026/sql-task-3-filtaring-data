-- 1. Filter by single condition using WHERE
SELECT * 
FROM students
WHERE age = 20;

-- 2. Filter by multiple conditions using AND
SELECT * 
FROM students
WHERE age > 18 AND city = 'Kolkata';

-- 3. Filter by multiple conditions using OR
SELECT * 
FROM students
WHERE city = 'Delhi' OR city = 'Mumbai';

-- 4. Search names starting with a letter using LIKE and %
SELECT * 
FROM students
WHERE name LIKE 'A%';

-- 5. Search names ending with a letter using LIKE

-- 7. Filter records using IN
SELECT * 
FROM students
WHERE city IN ('Delhi', 'Mumbai', 'Kolkata');

-- 8. Filter records using BETWEEN
SELECT * 
FROM students
WHERE age BETWEEN 18 AND 25;

-- 9. Handle NULL values
SELECT * 
FROM students
WHERE email IS NULL;

-- 10. Handle NOT NULL values
SELECT * 
FROM students
WHERE email IS NOT NULL;
-- 11. Combine AND, OR, LIKE in complex queries
SELECT * 
FROM students
WHERE (city = 'Delhi' OR city = 'Mumbai') 
  AND name LIKE 'A%';

-- 12. Using aliases for better readability
SELECT s.name AS student_name, s.age, s.city
FROM students s
WHERE s.age > 18;

-- 13. Real-life scenario: search by email domain
SELECT * 
FROM students
WHERE email LIKE '%@gmail.com';

-- 14. Fetch students with missing city OR age less than 18
SELECT * 
FROM students
WHERE city IS NULL OR age < 18;
-- 15. Fetch top students in specific grade range (example using BETWEEN)
SELECT *
